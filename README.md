This is a simple tool that will look up a zip code's information. The tool is running as a website hosted by GitHub pages and can be found https://cupshir.github.io .

Enter a zip code into the text form and press the look up button. If its a valid zip code, the results will be displayed. You can toggle between "pretty" results or the "raw" results.

The website is a standard structure with CSS living in the css folder and javascript living in the js folder.  The JQuery library is utilized to simplify the ajax api calls to look up the zip code information as well as the UI functionality.
